    "\n",
    "In decision-making problems, the need to make decisions based on phenomena with associated uncertainty frequently arises.\n",
    "\n",
    "A stochastic process is defined as a series of aleatory variables $\\{\\mathrm{Xt}\\}$, where index $t$ takes the values of a given set $T$. For example, process $X 1, X 2, X 3, \\ldots$ can represent a change made by customers in a detergent brand name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another simple case is that in which knowledge about the state of the system in consecutive instants prior to $t$ provides certain information on the state of the system, although this information is totally contained in the last instant. A process with these characteristics is called a Markov Process. For instance, if the change in a detergent brand name made by customers in one month depends only on their choice in the previous month.\n",
    "\n",
    "A stochastic process $\\{\\mathrm{Xt}\\}$ is a Markov Chain if it has the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A finite number of states.\n",
    "2. The Markovian property. This property is the equivalent to establishing that the conditional probability of any future \"event\", given any past \"event\" and the present state, is independent of the past event and that it depends only on the current process state.\n",
    "3. Stationary transition probabilities. Having stationary transition probabilities means that the transition probabilities do not change over time.\n",
    "4. A series of initial probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the transition probabilities (in the probabilities example of customers changing from one detergent brand name (state) to another) continue to be constant with time, the Markov Process is called a Markov Chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a Markov Chain: let's consider the following model for the a share value. At the end of a given day, the price is recorded. If the share goes up, the probability of it going up tomorrow is 0.7 . If the share goes down, the probability of it going up tomorrow is only 0.5 . This is a Markov Chain where state $0(\\mathrm{e} 0)$ represents the share price going up and state 1 (e1) represents it going down. The transition Matrix is given by:\n",

    "### 5.5 PROPOSED EXERCISE. REPAIRING RIVETING MACHINES\n",
    "\n",
    "On a daily basis, a maintenance technician of a given firm checks adjustments on an automatic machine that produces rivets for the air-sea industry, among other tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "By checking a certain number of rivets, he knows that it is not necessary to adjust the machine (A), it requires slight adjustment (B), some adjustment (C) or considerable adjustment (D).\n",
    "\n",
    "The technician has verified that if the machine is in state A, there is an $80 \\%$ probability that it will remain in this state until the next day, and a $20 \\%$ probability that it will enter state $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the machine is in state $B$, there is a $70 \\%$ probability that it will remain in this state until the next day, and a $5 \\%$ probability that it will require considerable adjustment.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the machine is in state $\\mathrm{C}$, there is a $50 \\%$ probability that it will require considerable adjustment, and it is quite certain that its state will not improve.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the machine requires considerable adjustment, it will remain in this state permanently.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the technician's job does not consist in stopping and observing the machine; instead, if the machine is found to be in state $D$, it must be adjusted. Nevertheless, the technician is not clear if when the machine is in any of the other states what interests the firm more from an economic perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because a complete adjustment costs 20,000 m.u. If the machine is in state A and begins to work at the beginning of the day, it will not produce any extra cost through loss of quality. If the technician adjusts it in state $B$, the cost for the firm is 5,000 m.u. that day, and it is 8,000 m.u. if the machine is in state C.\n",
    "\n",
    "The maintenance technician needs to economically evaluate if it is less costly to also adjust the machine completely when it is in state C.\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Model the problem with Markov Chains (one per maintenance policy) $(40 \\%)$\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Which policy is less costly? (40\\%)\n",
    "\n",
    "c) What would the adjustment cost be so that the answer to question b) would have been the opposite? $(10 \\%)$\n",
    "\n",
    "d) With the original maintenance policy, what is the expected firstpassage time from state $D$ to state $A$ ? What is the recurrence time of state $D$ ? (10\\%)\n"
